### Implemenation of [angular-ui-notification](https://github.com/alexcrack/angular-ui-notification) as it is

This implementation will contain `angular-ui-notification.min.js`,
`angular-ui-notification.min.css` from bower and that it, nothing has been changed.
 
So in order to have some documentation please take a look at:  
[angular-ui-notification](https://github.com/alexcrack/angular-ui-notification)

P.S.

There is no such implementation of this in `npm`, only different projects.
